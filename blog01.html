	            <p>As times change, programs should also evolve to meet the current needs of the business.
					In order for the program to be setup so that it could operate according
					to the current needs of the users, the program would need to be designed 
					to include the necesssary features. Understanding the different types of 
					software methodologies could define the abilities of the program
					and how the program could transform a business.

				<p> By understanding each type of methodolgy, it helps to determine
					which methodology could work best for the team and project. 
					Depending on the size of the team, the teams experience and 
					expertise in the methodology, the deadline for the project,
					and the type of project being developed, certain methodologies would work best. 
					To determine which type of methodolgy to utilize for the team and the project,

	            <p>Agile methodology is a project management approach that prioritizes 
					cross-functional collaboration and continuous improvement. 
					It divides projects into smaller phases and guides teams through cycles of planning,

					<ol>
						<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
						<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>

	            <p>The lean software development methodology is one of the software design 
					methods with a main focus on loss reduction. That is why the whole project is 
					examined significantly beforehand to eliminate any wasted time or money. 
					As value is the core component, feedback plays a crucial role itself, 
					so that the actions are taken fast.</p>

				<p></p>
				<img src="images/tech/waterfall-model.jpg" alt="waterfall development" class="img-fluid">
				<p></p>
				<p>The Waterfall methodology — also known as the Waterfall model — is a sequential 
					development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project 
					(analysis, design, development, and testing, for example), with each phase 
					completely wrapping up before the next phase begins.</p>
				<p>The success of the Waterfall method depends on the amount and quality of the work 
					done on the front end, documenting everything in advance, 
					including the user interface, user stories, and all the features’ variations 
					and outcomes.</p>
				<p>With the majority of the research done upfront, estimates of the time needed 
					for each requirement are more accurate, and this can provide a more predictable 
					release date. With a Waterfall project, if parameters change along the way, 
					it’s harder to change course than it is with Agile methodology.</p>

	            <p>Extreme Programming, also known as XP, is useful for projects that are designed to be
					dynamic to changing demands. This methodology has alot of felxbility because

				</p>
					<h9>Extreme Programming's Values are:</h9>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Communication</b></li>
							<p>Everyone on the team works closely togther at every stage of the project.</p>
						<li><b>Simplicity</b></li>
							<p>Developers strive for simple code in order to bring more value to the product
							as it saves time and effort in development.</p>
						<li><b>Feedback</b></li>
							<p>Developers deliver the software frequently and use feedback to improve the product
								according to the requirements.</p>
						<li><b>Courage</b></li>
							<p>Programmers  objectively evaluate their own results without making 
								excuses and are always ready to respond to changes.</p>
						<li><b>Respect</b></li>
							<p>Every person on the team understands their efforts contribute to the common goal.</p>
					</ul>

					<h9>Extreme Programming's Principles are: </h9>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Incremental changes</b></li>
							<p>Small changes are made to the design a little at a time and incoporated into the plan.</p>
						<li><b>Embracing change</b></li>
							<p>Programmers support the changes the client requests for and develops a plan on 
								how to implement the new requirements</p>
						<li><b>Assumed Simplicity</b></li>
							<p>Develvopers focus on the task important for the moment and  develop the program function(s) specific for the task.

						<li><b>Quality work</b></li>
							<p>A team that works well creates a valuable product and instills pride in the program</p>
						<li><b>Rapid Feedback</b></li>

				<img src="images/tech/prototyping.PNG" alt="prototyping development" class="img-fluid">
	            <p>The prototyping model is a system's development method thats works best if all 
					the project requirements are not known in detail ahead of time. 
					Therefore, an end product is developed, tested, and refined according to 
					the customers feedback till an acceptable prototype is achieved. 
					The process is a trial-and-error process that takes place between the 
					developers and the users.</p>

					<h9>Types of Prototyping Models:</h9>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Rapid throwaway</b></li>
							<p>This method involves exploring ideas by quickly developing a 
								prototype based on preliminary requirements that is then revised 
								through customer feedback. The name rapid throwaway refers to the 
								fact that each prototype is completely discarded and may not 
								be a part of the final product.</p>
						<li><b>Evolutionary</b></li>
							<p>This approach uses a continuous, working prototype that is refined 
								after each iteration of customer feedback. This method saves 
								time and effort because each prototype is not started from scratch.</p>
						<li><b>Incremental</b></li>
							<p>This technique breaks the concept for the final product into smaller pieces 
								and prototypes are created for each one. In the end, these prototypes 
								are merged into the final product.
							</p>
						<li><b>Extreme</b></li>
							<p>This prototype model is used specifically for web development. 
								All web prototypes are built in an HTML format with a services 
								layer and are then integrated into the final product.</p>

				<img src="images/tech/feature-driven.jpg" alt="feature-driven development" class="img-fluid">
	            <p>Feature-driven development (FDD) is a development methodology that emphasizes the 
					delivery of small, incremental features or units of functionality as the primary means 
					of progress.</p>
				<p>Each feature is developed through a series of small, well-defined steps, 
					called "development cycles," which involve a series of activities such as planning, 
					designing, building, and testing. These development cycles are typically focused 
					on the delivery of a single feature at a time, which allows the development team to 
					focus on a small, well-defined scope of work and to deliver working software to the 
					customer as quickly as possible</p>
				<p>Feature Driven Develpment (FDD) is an agile approach that is designed to be flexible and responsive

				<img src="images/tech/rup.PNG" alt="rational unified process" class="img-fluid">
	            <p>Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a software development process for object-oriented models and is also known as the Unified Process Model.
					Its primary purpose is to enable the creation of high-quality software that satisfies 
					the end user’s requirements within a predictable budget and timeframe.
				</p>
					<h9>Principles of RUP (Rational Unified Process):</h9>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Iterative and incremental development</b></li>
							<p>RUP emphasizes iterations, or cycles, of work, rather than trying to 
								complete all work upfront. This allows for more flexibility and 
								responsiveness to change. Each iteration results in a working version of 
								the software that can be demonstrated to, and used by, clients.</p>
						<li><b>Strong focus on requirements</b></li>
							<p>RUP puts strong emphasis on requirements gathering and management. 
								A project’s success depends on having a clear understanding of what the 
								client wants the final product to do. Only then can developers and project
								 managers plan out the necessary steps to create it.</p>
						<li><b>Architecture-centric development</b></li>
							<p>RUP takes an architecture-centric approach, meaning that the software’s 
								overall design is created first before any code is written. 
								This ensures that the final product will be well-structured and maintainable.
							</p>
						<li><b>Component-based development</b></li>
							<p>Component-based development is a technique for building software systems from 
								pre-existing components rather than from scratch. This speeds up development 
								time and results in more reliable code since proven components are reused.</p>

	            <p>The spiral model uses a systematic and iterative appraoch to software development. 
					Each spiral represents a phase of the software development. The number of spirals, or loops,
					for the project are unknown and the number of spirals varies from project to project.

					<li>Requirements are complex and need clarity</li>
					<li>Significant changes are expected during the development cycle</li>

				<p>Joint Appplication Development (JAD) is a process aimed at bringing the 
					stakeholders, developers, and users together in joint sessions. A joint session is 
					a workshop where project requirements and design are defined. The purpose of the design process
					is to have everyone come to a common consensus for the project requirements and to 
					foster effective and efficient communication between all who are involved. </p>
					
					<h9>Best practices for conducting a Joint Application Development (JAD) session:</h9>

					<ul>
						<li><b>Invite Relevant People</b></li>
							<p>JAD sessions ideally have 10 or fewer participants. 
								Of those, you should always have a facilitator, key executive, 
								end-user representative, developer, note-taker, and relevant specialists.
							</p>
						<li><b>Set Clear Goals</b></li>
							<p>Each session you conduct should have clearly defined goals and 
								outcomes. Define what you will discuss and any deliverables that 
								will be expected.
							</p>
						<li><b>Conduct Meetings Offsite</b></li>
							<p> To ensure meeting participants can focus and are not pulled 
								away for other tasks, conduct meetings outside of the workplace.
							</p>
						<li><b>Limit sessions</b></li>
							<p>You should hold no more than 10 JAD sessions or workshops to 
								ensure the project gets defined in a reasonable time period.
							</p>
						<li><b>Use Appropriate Tools</b></li>
							<p>During sessions you will want to make certain members have access to the 
								necessary tools, which can include project management software, 
								prototyping tools, and flowcharts.
							</p>
						<li><b>Create Deliverables</b></li>
							<p> At the end of your sessions, the facilitator should walk away with a clear 
								project definition, system prototypes, user-interface designs, timeframe 
								estimates, budget and resource needs, and any database schema the program will require.
							</p>
						<li><b>Final Approvals</b></li>
							<p>YAt the end of your JAD sessions you will need to obtain approval from the key 
								executive, as well as the end-user representative.
							</p>

				<img src="images/tech/kanban.jpg" alt="kanban development" class="img-fluid">
	            <p>Kanban methodology is a visual way that allows the team to visualize the project
					development process by using kanban boards and kanban cards. </p>

					<h9>Kanban's main principles are:</h9>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Start with what you’re doing now</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>The first step when implementing kanban is to focus on what the 
									organization is currently doing. Don’t make changes to your process 
									immediately, but use kanban to visualize your current workflow and 
									begin making improvements.
								</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Changes occur organically over time and shouldn’t be rushed</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>One of the key aspects of kanban is the notion of continuous 
									improvement, which consists of making small, incremental changes based 
									on careful observation of workflows instead of making radical changes.
								</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Respect current roles and responsibilities</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Implementing the kanban methodology doesn’t require any change in the 
									organizational structure of teams. Changes in roles and responsibilities 
									might come as the continuous improvement process advances but aren’t 
									part of the kanban methodology.
								</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Encourage leadership from everyone</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Kanban promotes a collaborative atmosphere where team members can suggest 
									improvement opportunities to help keep the mandate of continuous improvement 
									for maximizing efficiency.
								</li>
							</ul>
					</ol>

					<h9>Kanban's practices are:</h9>
					<ol>
						<!-- First point -->
						<li><b>Visualize workflow, whether through a physical board or kanban software</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>The Kanban board features three stages:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>To-do</li>
										<li>In progress</li>
										<li>Completed</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						<!-- Second point -->
						<li><b>Limit work-in-progress to keep teams executing tasks quickly</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>At any point in time, the Kanban board has just the right amount of work cards that can be handled by the resources available</li>
							</ul>
						<!-- Third point -->
						<li><b>Manage and improve workflow by observing work and resolving bottlenecks</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Flow refers to the movement of work items across stages of a process. The project manager keeps the workflow moving quickly while keeping an eye on blocks, bottlenecks, and risks</li>
							</ul>
						<!-- Fourth point -->
						<li><b>Be explicit with process policies: define and share them</b></li>
							
						<!-- Fifth point -->
						<li><b>Have feedback loops, such as review stages, to deliver the end product to the customer as quickly as possible</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>By having an explicit understanding of issues, operations, and rules, discussions become more rational and objective</li>
							</ul>
						<!-- Sixth point -->
						<li><b>Improve collaboratively, evolove experimentally</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>By using a model to predict the effect of change, it allows the team to have a shared comprehension of problems</li>
								<li>Some of the models include: 
									<ul>
										<li>The Theory of Constraints</li>
										<li>The Theory of Profound Knowledge</li>
										<li>The Lean Economic Model</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
					</ol>

				<img src="images/tech/scrum-methodology.webp" alt="scrum methodolgy" class="img-fluid">
	            <p>Scrum is a methodology that works in short cycles, called sprints, which has ongoing feedback.
					During a sprint, an inspection and adaption of the process occurs of what is expected to be delivered.
					Scrum is an empirical process, where decisions are based on observation, experience and 
					experimentation. Scrum has three pillars: transparency, inspection and 
					adaptation. This supports the concept of working iteratively.</p>

					<h9>Scrum values are:</h9>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Courage</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Each member has the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Focus</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Everyone fosuces on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Commitment</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Everyone personally commits to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Respect</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Openness</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work</li>
							</ul>

				<img src="images/tech/rad.webp" alt="rapid application development" class="img-fluid">
				<a href="https://kissflow.com/application-development/rad/rapid-application-development/#:~:text=Rapid%20Application%20Development%20or%20RAD,a%20prototype%2C%20rather%20than%20planning.">Image credit: Kissflow</a>
	            <p></p>
				<p>Rapid Application Development (RAD) is an adaptive software development model based on prototyping
					and quick feedback. It prioritizes development and building a prototype rather than planning.
					With RAD, developers are able to quickly make iterations and updates to the software without starting
					from scratch and the final outcome is mostly likely closely aligned with the end users' requirements.  
				</p>
					<h9>Steps in Rapid Application Development:</h9>
					<ol>
						<li>Define the requirements</li>
						<li>Prototype</li>
						<li>Construct</li>
						<li>Deploy</li>
					</ol>

	            <p></p>
	            <p>updates are made continuously, piece-by-piece, enabling software code to be delivered to customers as soon as it is completed and tested.</p>
				<h9>Continuous Deployment has 4 main practices:</h9>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Continuous integration</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Changes from different developers are merged back to main branch as soon as possible and then validated through automated tests to avoid integration-related issues</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Continuous delivery</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Continuous delivery automatically implements all verified code and pushes it from the build stage into testing and/or production environments. It employs an automated release process</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Continuous deployment</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Continuous deployment skips all of that and pushes every test-validated update live, into the hands of the end user</li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Continuous testing</b></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Automated, ongoing testing helps ensure that the changes moving forward are effective and of sufficient quality</li>
							</ul>
